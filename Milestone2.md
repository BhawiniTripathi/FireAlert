## Overview
Attempts were made to realize the user stories from Milestone 1 and the following progress was made.

### Completed Tasks
#### User Story 3
As an **administrator**, I want to **keep vigil over normal temperature**, so I can **monitor if the organization is maintaining prescribed environment for its employees**.
* Tracked temperature from the MetaWear Sensor using BLE connection.
*	Timestamp was attached to temperature data.
*	Displayed temperature along with timestamp on the mobile application by tapping a button.

#### User Story 1
As an **employee**, I want to **receive fire alerts** so I can **escape to safety**.
* Implemented a switch on the application as a prototype for door security functionality. 

### Future Extensions
* Receiving alert on the mobile application itself.
* Indicate on the application (as a prototype) when the door security functionality is disabled.
